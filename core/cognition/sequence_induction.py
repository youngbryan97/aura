"""Answering a "what comes next" question by working the rule out.

The induction machinery has had no consumer outside its own battery. It could
learn a transformation from observations, keep it, compose with it and carry it
to the next world, and none of that ever met a person: the research
architecture had the mechanism and the live agent did not use it.

This is the seam. When somebody shows a few before-and-after examples and asks
what a new case becomes, the runtime works the rule out, applies it, and says
what the rule was — and keeps the shape, so the next question of the kind is
cheaper. No model is consulted to do it.

Where it stays quiet
--------------------
Single values. "45 becomes 15, 28 becomes 14" is a relation between numbers,
not a rearrangement of positions, and the language here is about position and
value substitution. Answering it would mean guessing. Sequences of two or more
are where the mechanism actually works, and anywhere else this returns nothing
and the ordinary path runs.

It also stays quiet when the rule it finds does not account for every example
it was shown, which is the same discipline the invention itself applies.
