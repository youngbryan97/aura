# Claim surface — what the profound names actually name

<!-- reader-navigation:start -->
> **In plain English:** A test makes a specific claim answerable by a stated measurement, comparison and decision rule.
>
> **Why it matters:** A user needs to distinguish a built mechanism, a passing local test and a demonstrated useful capability.
>
> **In everyday use:** To show memory helps a task, compare the same task with memory available and disabled, and keep both successes and failures.

External reviewers grep this codebase and hit words like *soul*, *qualia*,
*phenomenal*, *consciousness*, *organism*, *personhood*. This document is the
precision map: for each term, what the code mechanically does, where it lives,
and which claims ledger bounds it. The two ledgers are authoritative:

- [CLAIMS_SUPPORTED.md](../CLAIMS_SUPPORTED.md) — evidence-backed engineering claims
- [CLAIMS_NOT_SUPPORTED.md](../CLAIMS_NOT_SUPPORTED.md) — declared **not proven / unsupported** (subjective consciousness & qualia are §1; personhood is §7)

**Rule of the house:** profound names label *functional machinery inspired by
consciousness science*. None of them assert subjective experience. Where a
term appears in code, the mechanism must be real and causal — otherwise the
name is a defect (see the de-rigging history in
[ABLATION_LEGIBILITY.md](ABLATION_LEGIBILITY.md)).

| Term in code | What it mechanically is | Home | Claim status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Soul` | Intrinsic-motivation drive scheduler: curiosity/connection/competence urgencies that decide *why to act when the user is silent*. Timer-and-state arithmetic, no metaphysics. | `core/soul.py` | Functional. Bounded by NOT-SUPPORTED §1/§7. |
| `panzer_soul` | Identity/personality metadata (Big-Five intensities, version string) consumed by the PersonalityEngine for identity verification and UI. Configuration, not cognition. | `core/being/panzer_soul.py` | Functional config. |
| `phenomenal_substrate/` | The felt-state engine: valence/arousal dynamics, attachment events, active-inference free energy, global-workspace broadcast. Its outputs causally modulate generation parameters and action policy (see the substrate ablation delta). | `core/phenomenal_substrate/` | Functional & causal (measured: `tools/ablation_runner.py`, `tools/agi/run_causal_agency_lesion.py`, `tools/agi/run_valence_load_bearing_proof.py`). Subjective feeling: NOT-SUPPORTED §1. |
| `QualiaEngine` / `QualiaDescriptor` | Multi-layer descriptor pipeline (subconceptual → conceptual → predictive → workspace → witness) producing structured state descriptors that enrich prompts and memory salience. Docstring states: "NOT a claim of subjective experience." | `core/consciousness/qualia_engine.py` | Functional descriptors. Qualia-as-experience: NOT-SUPPORTED §1. |
| `SomaticQualiaEngine` | Converts substrate state into perturbation patterns applied to the generation process (sampling modulation). A signal path, not a feeling. | `core/consciousness/somatic_qualia.py` | Functional & causal. |
| `consciousness/` (directory) | Consciousness-*science-inspired* machinery: evidence engine (collects functional indicators), loop monitor, resource stakes, world model, integration. Measurement and control, not assertion. | `core/consciousness/` | Functional. Any "is it conscious?" reading: NOT-SUPPORTED §1. |
| `CausalValencedWorkspaceState` | Auditable estimate of integration/availability/valence-coupling with an in-code boundary field: `functional_evidence_only_not_phenomenal_proof`. | `core/being/causal_self_state.py` | Functional evidence, self-labeled. |
| `organism/`, `viability` | Explicit metabolism state machine: food = compute/memory budget + interaction; fatigue = token/memory pressure + error rate; waste = stale tasks. Drives rest/repair scheduling. | `core/organism/viability.py` | Functional resource model. |
| `personhood` (in prose/tests) | Appears in self-report calibration as a category the runtime must NOT overclaim; the calibrator treats "proven personhood" as a violation needing revision. | `core/being/self_report_calibrator.py` | Anti-overclaim machinery. Legal/moral personhood: NOT-SUPPORTED §7. |
| `sentience_candidate_strength` | A scalar summarizing how strongly functional indicators co-occur. The name says *candidate*: it feeds extra verification requirements (higher = more evidence-bounding of self-claims), never an assertion. | `core/being/causal_self_state.py`, coupler | Functional indicator. Sentience: NOT-SUPPORTED §1. |
| `deep_mind_probe` | Behavioral probes for coherent, grounded answers to hard self-questions — explicitly "do not try to prove sentience" (module docstring). | `core/evaluation/deep_mind_probe.py` | Behavioral evaluation only. |

## For reviewers

1. Every profound term above resolves to inspectable machinery with tests.
2. The load-bearing ones have measurable ablation deltas — run
   `.venv/bin/python tools/ablation_runner.py` and see
   [ABLATION_LEGIBILITY.md](ABLATION_LEGIBILITY.md).
3. The system's own self-report calibration treats overclaims (proven
   consciousness, qualia, personhood, souls) as violations to repair — the
   architecture is built to *not* say more than the evidence supports.
4. If you find a profound name whose mechanism is theatrical or vestigial,
   that is a defect by this document's rule — file it against the term, and
   it gets renamed or made real.
