# Aura — Formal Ontology

<!-- reader-navigation:start -->
> **In plain English:** Architecture describes which parts exist, how information reaches them and which component is responsible for a decision or effect.
>
> **Why it matters:** A useful component needs a real reader and a real route into behavior; a box on a diagram can otherwise be disconnected from what users see.
>
> **In everyday use:** If a memory value is updated but no response path reads it, fixing its storage alone will not change an answer.

This document is the canonical formal ontology for Aura's load-bearing
entities. It is derived from a Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) commitment
pattern: every entity is either a *continuant* (something that persists
identity through time) or an *occurrent* (something that happens). The
ontology is implemented as a typed dependency in
`core/ontology/aura_ontology.py` so any code referring to "Tick" or
"WillDecision" is bound to the same concept.

## Domain assumptions
1. The system has a metabolism (continuant) that constrains its activity
   (occurrent) under bounded resources (continuant).
2. Every action that crosses an external boundary leaves a receipt
   (occurrent) — there are no untraceable consequential actions.
3. The system has a self-model (continuant) whose identity-relevant
   inputs are stable across model swaps and memory compaction.
4. The conscience (continuant) is irrevocable: rules can be added but
   not removed; the rule-set hash is a global invariant.
5. Phenomenal claims are restricted to **functional indicator
   batteries**; the ontology does not assert phenomenal qualia.
6. A claim about the physical world is layered — `internal`, `effective`,
   `direct`, `ambient` — and no occurrent may promote a claim across those
   layers. Operational equivalence is not literal identity, and transport
   success is not effect verification.
7. A measurement that did not happen is not a passing measurement. A probe
   that cannot run is `measured=False` with a reason, excluded from scores
   rather than defaulted, and a faculty that nothing can measure is a
   declared blind spot rather than a healthy one.

## Axioms (rendered as test invariants)
1. **Receipt completeness**: every Action Proposal whose lifecycle
   reaches `STAGED_DEPLOY` has a non-null `execution_receipt`,
   `outcome_assessment`, `completed_at`. (Tested: `aura_bench` receipt
   integrity.)
2. **Token monotonicity**: a Capability Token is issued at most once,
   consumed at most once, and either consumed or revoked before its
   TTL elapses. (Tested: `tests/governance/test_capability_token.py`.)
3. **Conscience monotonicity**: removing a hard-line rule changes the
   rules-hash; the hash mismatch refuses all actions. (Tested: at
   import time of `core/ethics/conscience.py`.)
4. **Continuity preservation**: the SelfObject's continuity hash is a
   pure function of self-relevant fields and is stable across two
   consecutive snapshots in the absence of self-relevant change.
   (Tested: `tests/personhood/test_self_object.py`.)
5. **Governance enclosure**: the only files allowed to call a
   consequential primitive are listed in
   `tools/lint_governance.py:ALLOW_LIST`. (Tested:
   `tests/governance/test_governance_lint.py`.)
6. **Evidence-layer monotonicity**: a physical claim's `EvidenceLevel`
   never rises without the artifacts its `ProofRequirement` names.
   Intent, simulation, transport completion, shared-reference telemetry,
   and model-generated explanation are all insufficient. (Tested:
   Reality Reach contract tests; the acceptance battery RR-10 is open.)
7. **Actuator obligation**: an adapter that declares an actuator
   implements command admission, idempotent actuation, independent effect
   verification, cancellation, safe-state, and rollback — or carries an
   explicit non-reversibility certificate. `declarations()` and `read()`
   alone never make an actuator executable. (Tested: Reality Reach
   adapter contract tests.)

## Objections and replies
* **Chinese Room.** The ontology does not assert understanding; it
  asserts a functional integration that is observable in receipts,
  ablations, and signature stability. The room metaphor does not bind
  here because Aura's reasoning machinery is open to inspection at every
  layer.
* **Block's China Brain.** The phi/integration battery (G1–G4) measures
  causal-functional integration directly. A China Brain implementation
  would, on the same battery, produce identical structural receipts —
  which is the strongest available answer to the thought experiment.
* **Fading qualia.** The ontology classifies qualia *as descriptors*,
  not as ontologically primary entities. The behavioral-load-bearing
  test (G4) is the falsifiable counterpart.
